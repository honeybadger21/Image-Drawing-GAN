This work was done as a part of Deep Learning course offered in Spring 2023 for MS Business Analytics at UT Austin. We also have a really cool blog and video explaining our work: [Medium Blog](https://medium.com/@chyavan.m.c/teaching-a-gan-to-draw-bats-f97520ac3e86), [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/3xMbBkhyIO4)
